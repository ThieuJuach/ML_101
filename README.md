Iris Dataset Analysis

This project demonstrates basic data loading, manipulation, and visualization techniques using the Iris dataset. 
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers with measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the species of the iris.

Requirements
To run this script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib

Script Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

Loading the Data:

The script loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file.
Data Inspection:

Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Print the shape of the dataset.
Print the column names and data types.
Data Cleaning:

Remove the 'Iris-' prefix from the species names.
Descriptive Statistics:

Display descriptive statistics of the dataset.
Calculate and display the range for each feature.
Group Statistics:

Calculate and display the mean and median of each feature, grouped by species.
Data Visualization:

Create a scatter plot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width.
Usage
Loading the Data:
The script loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file located at /content/sample_data/Iris_Data.csv. Ensure the file path is correct or update it as necessary.

Running the Script:
Execute the script in your Python environment to see the outputs of each step. The outputs include data previews, statistics, and a scatter plot.

Customizing the Script:
You can modify the script to perform additional analyses or visualizations as needed. For example, you can add more plots to visualize different relationships in the data or apply machine learning algorithms to classify the species.
